        question: "What distinguishes Network Security Monitoring from traditional intrusion detection?",
        options: [
          "NSM only uses signature-based detection",
          "NSM focuses on collection, detection, AND analysis of network data for situational awareness",
          "NSM replaces the need for endpoint security entirely",
          "NSM only monitors wireless networks"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "NSM goes beyond simple alerting by combining data collection, detection, and human-driven analysis to build comprehensive situational awareness of network activity."

        options: [
          "ACK → SYN → SYN-ACK",
          "SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK",
          "SYN → ACK → SYN-ACK",
          "FIN → SYN → ACK"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "The TCP three-way handshake proceeds: client sends SYN, server responds with SYN-ACK, client completes with ACK — establishing a reliable connection."

        id: "nsm-q1-3",
        question: "Why is UDP significant from a security monitoring perspective?",
        options: [
          "UDP is always encrypted",
          "UDP's connectionless nature makes it harder to track sessions and easier for attackers to spoof",
          "UDP cannot be used for data exfiltration",
          "UDP traffic is automatically blocked by firewalls"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "UDP is connectionless with no handshake, making it difficult to track sessions and easy for attackers to spoof source addresses — commonly abused in DNS amplification attacks and covert channels."

        question: "At which OSI layer does a network TAP operate to capture traffic?",

          "Layer 4 – Transport",
          "Layer 1 – Physical",
          "Layer 3 – Network"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "Network TAPs operate at the Physical layer (Layer 1), creating an exact electrical or optical copy of all traffic passing through a link without introducing latency."

        id: "nsm-q1-5",
        question: "What is the primary disadvantage of using a SPAN/mirror port compared to a network TAP?",
        options: [
          "SPAN ports are more expensive than TAPs",
          "SPAN ports can drop packets under heavy load and may miss full-duplex traffic",
          "SPAN ports only capture Layer 2 traffic",
          "SPAN ports require custom hardware"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "SPAN ports mirror traffic via the switch CPU, which can drop packets under load. They may also not capture Layer 1 errors, malformed frames, or full-duplex conversations accurately."

          "A record",
          "TXT record"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "The A (Address) record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. AAAA records serve the same purpose for IPv6 addresses."

        id: "nsm-q1-7",
        question: "What is the purpose of the TTL field in an IP packet header from a defender's perspective?",
        options: [
          "It encrypts the packet payload",
          "It limits the packet's lifetime and can reveal OS fingerprinting and routing anomalies",
          "It specifies the packet's priority level",
          "It determines the maximum segment size"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "TTL (Time to Live) limits how many hops a packet can traverse. Different operating systems set different initial TTL values, enabling passive OS fingerprinting. Unusual TTL values can also indicate tunneling or spoofing."
      },

        id: "nsm-q1-8",
        question: "Which sensor placement strategy provides the broadest visibility of external threats?",
        options: [
          "Behind the internal firewall only",
          "On individual endpoint machines",
          "At the network perimeter between the external firewall and the internet",
          "Only on the DMZ segment"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "Placing sensors at the network perimeter captures all inbound and outbound traffic before internal filtering, providing maximum visibility of external threat actor activity."

          "Firewall logs only",
          "Summary statistics of network flows"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "Full content data refers to complete packet captures (PCAPs) that include all headers and payloads — the most detailed form of network evidence, essential for forensic analysis."

        id: "nsm-q1-10",
        question: "Which protocol typically uses port 443 and obscures payload content from network monitors?",

          "HTTP",
          "DNS",
          "HTTPS/TLS",
          "FTP"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "HTTPS uses TLS encryption on port 443, making payload inspection impossible without TLS interception. Attackers frequently use HTTPS for C2 to blend with legitimate traffic."

        options: [

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,

        correctAnswer: 1,

        correctAnswer: 1,

        options: [
          "ICMP is always encrypted",

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "ICMP echo (ping) is universally allowed. Attackers embed data in the payload field. Detection requires inspecting ICMP payload sizes (abnormally large), content (non-standard patterns), and session frequency."

      { id: "nf-q10-21", question: "IPv6 addresses are how many bits long?", options: ["32", "64", "96", "128"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "IPv6 addresses are 128 bits, providing approximately 3.4 × 10^38 unique addresses — solving IPv4 address exhaustion." },
      { id: "nf-q10-22", question: "What is the purpose of a default gateway?", options: ["DNS resolution", "Forwards traffic to destinations outside the local subnet", "DHCP assignment", "MAC learning"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "The default gateway (typically a router) forwards packets when the destination IP is not on the local subnet — it's the exit point for the LAN." },
      { id: "nf-q10-23", question: "Which Wireshark feature lets you follow an entire TCP conversation?", options: ["Display filter", "Follow TCP Stream", "Capture filter", "Protocol hierarchy"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Follow TCP Stream reconstructs and displays the complete data exchange of a TCP session, making it easy to read application-layer conversations." },
