"""
Heals QuizScore records that were wrongly recorded as failed due to the
mis-generated quiz_answers.py (wrong correct-answer indices).

Every quiz submitted before the fix was scored against the wrong answer key,
so the database has passed=False / low score for users who actually passed
on the frontend.

This command sets passed=True, score=70 for every existing record that still
has passed=False, so no user has to retake anything.

Run once on the production server after deploying the quiz_answers.py fix:
    python manage.py heal_quiz_scores
    python manage.py heal_quiz_scores --dry-run   # preview without writing
