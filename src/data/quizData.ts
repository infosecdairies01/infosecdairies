        question: "What is the primary disadvantage of using a SPAN/mirror port compared to a network TAP?",
        options: [
          "SPAN ports are more expensive than TAPs",
          "SPAN ports only capture Layer 2 traffic",
          "SPAN ports can drop packets under heavy load and may miss full-duplex traffic",
          "SPAN ports require custom hardware"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "SPAN ports mirror traffic via the switch CPU, which can drop packets under load. They may also not capture Layer 1 errors, malformed frames, or full-duplex conversations accurately."

        question: "What is the purpose of the TTL field in an IP packet header from a defender's perspective?",
        options: [
          "It limits the packet's lifetime and can reveal OS fingerprinting and routing anomalies",
          "It specifies the packet's priority level",
          "It determines the maximum segment size",
          "It encrypts the packet payload"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "TTL (Time to Live) limits how many hops a packet can traverse. Different operating systems set different initial TTL values, enabling passive OS fingerprinting. Unusual TTL values can also indicate tunneling or spoofing."

        question: "What is the difference between a Wireshark capture filter and a display filter?",
        options: [
          "Display filters are applied before capture begins",
          "Capture filters only work on wireless interfaces",

        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "Capture filters (BPF syntax, e.g., 'host 10.0.0.1') determine what packets are saved to disk. Display filters (Wireshark syntax, e.g., 'ip.addr == 10.0.0.1') filter the view of already-captured data."

        ],

        correctAnswer: 3,

        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "In IDS mode, Suricata passively copies and analyzes traffic. In IPS (inline) mode, traffic flows through Suricata, enabling 'drop' and 'reject' actions to block malicious packets in real time."

        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "DNS exfiltration encodes data in subdomain queries (e.g., base64data.evil.com). Since DNS is rarely blocked, attackers can slowly extract data — detectable by monitoring query length, volume, and entropy."

What is it doing?", options: ["VM detection — anti-analysis technique to detect virtual machine environments and alter behavior", "Looking for dependencies", "Process injection", "Checking for updates"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Checking for VM-specific processes is a common anti-analysis technique.

      { id: "nf-q10-22", question: "What is the purpose of a default gateway?", options: ["DNS resolution", "Forwards traffic to destinations outside the local subnet", "MAC learning", "DHCP assignment"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "The default gateway (typically a router) forwards packets when the destination IP is not on the local subnet — it's the exit point for the LAN." },
      { id: "nf-q10-23", question: "Which Wireshark feature lets you follow an entire TCP conversation?", options: ["Follow TCP Stream", "Display filter", "Capture filter", "Protocol hierarchy"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Follow TCP Stream reconstructs and displays the complete data exchange of a TCP session, making it easy to read application-layer conversations." },
      { id: "nf-q10-24", question: "What is MAC flooding?", options: ["A firmware update", "An attack that overwhelms a switch's MAC table, causing it to broadcast all traffic like a hub", "A VLAN configuration method", "A legitimate switch feature"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "MAC flooding fills the switch's CAM table with fake entries, causing the switch to fail-open and flood all frames to all ports — enabling traffic sniffing." },
      { id: "nf-q10-25", question: "What is the difference between single-mode and multi-mode fiber?", options: ["Multi-mode is always faster", "Same technology, different colors", "Single-mode is only for LANs", "Single-mode: smaller core, longer distance, laser; Multi-mode: larger core, shorter distance, LED"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "Single-mode (~9μm core) uses laser for long distances (up to 80+ km). Multi-mode (~50-62.5μm) uses LED for shorter distances (up to ~2 km)." },
      { id: "nf-q10-26", question: "What port does SSH use by default?", options: ["23", "22", "20", "25"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "SSH uses port 22 for secure, encrypted remote access — replacing insecure Telnet (port 23)." },
      { id: "nf-q10-27", question: "What is CIDR notation /16 equivalent to in dotted decimal?", options: ["255.255.0.0", "255.255.255.128", "255.255.255.0", "255.0.0.0"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "/16 means 16 network bits are set to 1: 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 = 255.255.0.0." },
      { id: "nf-q10-28", question: "Which protocol provides encrypted remote file transfer?", options: ["TFTP", "Telnet", "FTP", "SFTP/SCP"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and SCP (Secure Copy) provide encrypted file transfer over SSH, unlike FTP which sends data in cleartext." },
      { id: "nf-q10-29", question: "What is Zero Trust networking?", options: ["An outdated security model", "No security at all", "A wireless-only concept", "A model where no user or device is trusted by default — every access request must be verified"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust — every user, device, and connection must be continuously verified regardless of location (internal or external)." },
      { id: "nf-q10-30", question: "A user can ping their default gateway but cannot access external websites. What should you check next?", options: ["Change the MAC address", "DNS resolution and upstream routing — the local network works but internet access or name resolution may be failing", "Replace the Ethernet cable", "Reinstall the OS"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Since local connectivity works (gateway is reachable), check DNS settings (try pinging 8.8.8.8 by IP), upstream router connectivity, and ISP status." }
